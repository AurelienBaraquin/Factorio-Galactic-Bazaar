# Data model: the mod's `storage`

What the mod persists in its `storage` table (saved with the map, restored on load), who writes
each part, and the invariants the game does not enforce. Read it before changing the shape of
`storage`: a change of shape needs a migration in the same change.

## `storage.forces`

`storage.forces[force_index]` — the economy state of one force ([ADR-0001](adr/0001-economy-state-scoped-by-force.md)).
Keyed by `LuaForce.index` (a number), never by the `LuaForce` object.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `balance` | number | credits held by the force; never negative |
| `journal` | array | last `account.JOURNAL_SIZE` (100) transactions, oldest first: the caller's fields (`tick`, `kind`, …) plus `amount` and the resulting `balance` |
| `markets` | table | `[key] = {displacement, tick, rng, history}`: this force's market for each key read so far ([market.md](market.md)); created on first read |

Account rules (`scripts/core/account.lua`): `account.apply(state, amount, entry)` is atomic — a
refused transaction (`invalid-amount`, `insufficient-funds`) changes nothing.

Invariants (kept by `scripts/forces.lua`, logic in `scripts/core/force_registry.lua`):

- there is exactly one state per existing force, **including the built-in `enemy` and
  `neutral` forces** (no special case; code that processes economies iterates the forces that
  own trading entities, not all states): created on `on_init` and `on_force_created`, and
  reconciled on `on_configuration_changed` as a self-heal for missed events (missing states
  created, states of vanished forces dropped);
- when forces merge (`on_forces_merging`), the source state is folded into the destination and
  removed: balances add up, journals are joined in tick order and trimmed, the destination keeps
  its own markets. A new field must
  define how two values combine, in `force_registry.merge`;
- `force_registry.ensure` fills in any field a state lacks, so a save from an older version is
  upgraded on `on_configuration_changed` without a separate migration;
- the source state is removed at `on_forces_merging`, while the source force still exists until
  the end of the tick: **readers must accept a missing state** (nil-check); only write paths call
  `force_registry.ensure`;
- nothing writes `storage` during `on_load`.

## `storage.base_values`

`storage.base_values["item/<name>"]` and `storage.base_values["fluid/<name>"]` — base value in
credits of every tradeable item and fluid ([ADR-0002](adr/0002-base-value-from-the-production-graph.md)).
Shared by all forces: it depends only on prototypes. Written by `scripts/pricing.lua`, read with
`pricing.base_value(kind, name)`.

Invariants:

- rebuilt from the prototypes on `on_init` and on every `on_configuration_changed` (mods,
  versions, startup settings or prototypes changed), never edited elsewhere;
- every value is finite and at least 10⁻⁶; a key with no value (`nil`) is not tradeable.

## `storage.hubs`

`storage.hubs[unit_number] = {entity = LuaEntity}` — every trading hub that exists
([terminal.md](terminal.md)). Written by `scripts/hubs.lua` on build events and
`on_object_destroyed`; invalid entries are dropped on `on_configuration_changed`. Read entities
with `hubs.get(unit_number)`, which checks `valid`.

## `storage.cargo`

`{modules = {[unit_number] = {entity, kind = "export"|"import", hub = hub unit_number|nil,
min_price_ratio, export_index}}, exports = {unit_number...}, cursor}` — every cargo chest and the
round-robin order of export chests ([terminal.md](terminal.md)). Written by `scripts/cargo.lua`.
Invariants: `exports` lists exactly the export modules and `modules[exports[i]].export_index == i`
(removal swaps the last entry in); `hub` is a hint, re-checked before every use — a module only
works through a valid, powered hub of its own force; invalid entries are dropped and every module
re-attached on `on_configuration_changed`.

Personal data: none. Backups: `storage` lives inside the save file.
